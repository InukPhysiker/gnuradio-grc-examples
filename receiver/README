This directory contains simple but functional receiver examples
implemented using the GNU Radio Companion.

Before you execute any of the scripts you should check the USRP and
audio settings to ensure that they are compatible with your hardware.

The xyz_rec.grc and xyz_play.grc files are special editions of the receivers
that I have used for recording and playback of the received spectrum.

More information and video demos are available at
